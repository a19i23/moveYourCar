# moveYourCar test
Project sends a slack message to an authorized team if appropriate data is found.
Scrapes a website to see if there is a University of Texas baseball game. My wife parks in a lot that is used by the
baseball patrons so if she doesn't move it will get a nasty ticket. This script will send her a slack message and
also a reminder if she needs to move her car.
