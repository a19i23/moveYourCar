# moveYourCar
Webscraper that sends an slack message to a authorized team if appropriate data is found
This repo scrapes a website to see if there is a University of Texas baseball game. My wife parks in a lot that is used by the 
baseball patrons so if she doesn't move it will get a nasty ticket. This script will send her an slack message if she needs to move her car.
